# Quantum-Machine-Learning

# Introduction
  This project features methods to use simple classic and quantum neural networks to try their efficiency when it comes to decipher a database. Using various libraries such as Tensorflow and Pennylane, it showcases how far a neural network can learn a decryption method based on ciphered and clear data assumed leaked from a database.
